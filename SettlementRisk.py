# Settlement Risk (FX) - Also known as Herstatt Risk, this is the risk in an FX transaction where one party may deliver a currency but won't receive the currency it bought.
# Named after incident with Herstatt bank collapse in 1974. Occured because of the varying time zones, there is sometimes several hours when one end is settled and the other isn't


# step 1 : calculate exposure
#exposure = notional * exchange_rate_variation

# step 2 : assess timing mismatch
#time_difference = settlement_time1 - settlement_time2


# step 3 : Set exposure by analysing time difference between trades
#if time_difference > 0:
 #  settlement_risk = exposure
#else:
#   settlement_risk = 0

# Set probability of default (based on counterparty credit rating / historical data)
#probability_of_default = get_counterparty_default_probability(counterparty)
#expected_loss = settlement_risk * probability_of_default


# implement stress testing by simulating different market conditions to assess how the settlement risk would vary
